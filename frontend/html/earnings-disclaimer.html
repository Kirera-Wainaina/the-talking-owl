    <h1>Earnings Disclaimer</h1>

    <p>Reputation is more important than money - Publilius Syrus</p>

    <p>
      Like everyone else, we want to keep the lights on. Our main 
      methods of making money through this website are advertisements
       and referral income.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The advertisements are clearly marked as such. Please do not
        take their placement as an endorsement from us. We use external
        ad networks and different users will see different advertisements.
        We assure you that your user experience is of the utmost priority
         to us.
      </li>

      <li>
        We may get paid a small commission should you click on a 
        link we have placed on our website and then make a purchase 
        on the vendor platform where the link led you to. The small 
        amount we earn has no effect on the price that you pay. The
        price remains the same whether or not you use our link to make
        the purchase. We are very grateful whenever you purchase through
        us.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Though we make money, we will not do it at the expense of our
      audience or our reputation with you. Here are measures we take.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        We have stated in the earlier section how we make money. We
        therefore won’t pretend that we are unbiased. We will take
        the next best thing; objectivity. You can assess our objectivity
        in how we write. We will present a fair and clear picture of
        what a product or service entails.
      </li>

      <li>
        We will only recommend a product we would use. It’s only
        reasonable to do so. If we keep recommending bad products,
        eventually our readers learn not to trust us.
      </li>

      <li>
        Should we receive compensation to advertise a product, we will
        mention it to you. A sponsored display is not a recommendation.
        The sponsor is paying us for exposure to our readers base. 
      </li>

      <li>
        Should we discuss a sponsored product, we will give our objective
        opinion that is free from the influence of the sponsor.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      We are proud to provide this content to you at no cost. We aim
      to keep it that way. If you ever feel we are not meeting our
      promise for objectivity, please let us know. You can reach out
      to us through our contacts. 
    </p>
