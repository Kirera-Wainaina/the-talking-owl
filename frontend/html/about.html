    <p>Who's We?</p>

    <h2>Kirera Wainaina</h2>

    <p>
      I find it hard to string two sentences about myself 
      together, but here goes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I am a curious student of life. Being part of the Talking Owl
      is how I express my curiosity in the business context.
      Business is one of those often misunderstood arenas in life. 
      For many people, success is a mystery. I want to decipher 
      the causes of success for myself, but don't worry I will
      share what I find along the way. In fact, we can walk 
      the journey together.
    </p>

    <h2>Stacey Mulai</h2>

    <p id="last-paragraph">
      Stacey is our creative director. If you think the site 
      looks good, that's probably because of her. She handles 
      everything creative including web and graphic design.
      She is a major part of content curation for The Talking 
      Owl. She is also a perfectionist at heart but will never
      admit it.
