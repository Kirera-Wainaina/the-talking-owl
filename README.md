# The Talking Owl
The Talking Owl is a Content Management System for a blog hosted at [thetalkingowl.com](https://thetalkingowl.com). There are many content management systems out there but there is a lot outside the control of the owner. It is hard to handle programmatic SEO if you don't own the website for instance.
It is also a cool project to tackle on my own.

## Tech stack
I enjoy writing from the ground up and these are the technologies that I am using.
- **Node.js** => The website will be server side rendered. Pure Node.js. No framework.
- **Vanilla js** => No framework.
- **HTML/CSS** => Goes without saying
- **Google Firestore** => Database. It'll store the articles and links to images.
- **AWS** => For hosting
- **Puppeteer** => Server render the articles and store them as HTML files

## Goals
- Create a highly customizable and performant website. 
- Stick to the core web vitals for SEO purposes.

There is also more information about the architecture of the website on [Architecture.md](./Architecture.md). It has a breakdown on how the code is structureed. Check it out if you are interested in that kind of thing.
